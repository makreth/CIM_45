				<h3>About Me</h3>
				<img id = "profile" src = "profile.jpg" alt = ""/>
				<p> My name is Duncan Shepherd. I'm on my third year at IVC,
				and I'm working to transfer to a four-year institution for 
				Computer Science. I love to create with writing. I like to write
				stories, websites, programs, and even board game rules. I treat
				writing much like tinkering at a workstation, where I explore
				and fiddle with tools available to me on the internet. To me,
				the internet is a workstation of near infinite complexity
				and breadth, and it's essentially free. That's really exciting.</p>

			<h3>Why I'm Taking This Class</h3>
			<p>I'm entirely self-taught with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I want
			to learn the best practices in creating and deploying mobile-focused
			websites, from which I can work toward confidently constructing a
			professional portfolio. I program with intense focus, mainly
			because I rely on my knowledge of basic programming to code more
			complex tasks, and I flail to Stack Overflow if that fails me.
			This can lead to a lot of frustration, since I'm very inefficient.
			Thus, I hope to dig deeper into website design, because I know 
			I've only scratched the surface.</p>

						W3Schools - My Teacher
					</a>
					<aside>
						<p>W3Schools is the largest web developer site. Well,
						I assume it to be, since it says it on the tin.
						This is where I got most of my hobbyist programming
						information from. I've programmed pretty cool website
						apps just from this site, and it is my primary reference
						for HTML and CSS. However, since I'm a W3Schools baby, most
						of my knowledge is spotty, incohesive, and lacking in many
						areas that don't revolve around pretty styling or cool
						javascript tricks.</p>

						Stack Overflow - My Crutch
					</a>
					<aside>
						<p>Stack Overflow has become a programming meme of sorts.
						I've seen a funny video about expectations vs. reality with
						programming. Programmers have been glorified by movies as
						awesome hacking ninjas. Though those ninjas definitely exist,
						in reality, programmers	can find themselves in a loop of 
						hitting run, sighing in disappointment at red text, going
						to stack overflow, fiddling	with the code, and repeating 
						that process until it works. I eventually want to get to
						the point where I can hack/program with awesome synthwave
						music in the background, plus the shades and the matrix outfit,
						but I'm a stack overflow plebian at the moment.</p>

						REPL.IT - A Cool Online Programming Tool

					<aside>
						<p> repl.it is a nice online compiler for multiple languages,
						such as Python, Objective-C, Java, etc. It does HTML/CSS/
						Javascript on the fly as well, and it also immediately hosts
						all created webpages on repl's server, so it can be shared with
						anyone. Case in point, here's a little
